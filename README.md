# Airbnb Analysis using MongoDB Atlas

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends. The objectives are to:
- Establish a MongoDB connection and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.
- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Develop a streamlit web application with interactive maps showcasing the distribution of Airbnb listings.
- Conduct price analysis and visualization.
- Analyze availability patterns across seasons.
- Investigate location-based insights.
- Create interactive visualizations.
- Build a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI.

## MongoDB Atlas Setup
1. **Create a MongoDB Atlas Account:** Sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account on the MongoDB Atlas website and follow the registration process to set up your account and create a new project.
2. **Set Up a Cluster:** Within your MongoDB Atlas project, set up a cluster. Choose the cloud provider and region for hosting your data, configure the cluster specifications, and create the cluster. This will serve as the database environment for storing the sample data.
3. **Load the Airbnb Sample Data:** Access the MongoDB Atlas dashboard, create a database user, and set up IP whitelisting or other security measures. Import the Airbnb sample data into your cluster from the "Clusters" page by selecting the "Load Sample Dataset" option.

## Approach
### 1. MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval
- Establish a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.
- Perform queries and data retrieval operations to extract the necessary information for analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Clean the Airbnb dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types as necessary.
- Prepare the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

### 3. Geospatial Visualization
- Develop a streamlit web application utilizing geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset to create interactive maps.
- Visualize the distribution of listings across different locations, allowing users to explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors.

### 4. Price Analysis and Visualization
- Analyze and visualize price variations across different locations, property types, and seasons.
- Create dynamic plots and charts enabling users to explore price trends, outliers, and correlations with other variables.

### 5. Availability Analysis by Season
- Analyze the availability of Airbnb listings based on seasonal variations.
- Visualize occupancy rates, booking patterns, and demand fluctuations throughout the year.

### 6. Location-Based Insights
- Investigate price variations across different locations using MongoDB queries and data aggregation techniques.
- Visualize insights on interactive maps or create dashboards in tools like Tableau or Power BI.

### 7. Interactive Visualizations
- Develop dynamic and interactive visualizations allowing users to filter and drill down into the data based on their preferences.
- Enable users to interact with visualizations to explore specific regions, property types, or time periods.

### 8. Dashboard Creation
- Utilize Tableau or Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard presenting key insights from the analysis.
- Combine different visualizations such as maps, charts, and tables to provide a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and its patterns.
